# PoE.py
Path of Exile wiki wrapper in python
What it can currently do:
1. Search for all possible items, including hideout doodads.  
2. Use complex filters with math operators, for example search for an item with requirement of level 42 and strength requirement of 10.  
3. Data is presented in Item/Armour/Weapon/Gem objects, all of which inherit from ItemBase
4. It can render items as on the wiki or inside the game itself in the form of PNGs using Pillow/PIL.
